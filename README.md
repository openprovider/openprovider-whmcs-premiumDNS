Openprovider’s premium DNS leverages Sectigo’s advanced DNS infrastructure to provide a single, 
integrated and easy to adopt solution which offers a 99.99% Uptime Guarantee and near real-time updates,

service to your hosting services portfolio.

## Premium DNS setup

Openprovider’s Premium DNS is the latest addition to our product portfolio, and you can offer it to your customers directly via WHMCS. 
We are extending our successful collaboration with Sectigo, an industry leader in SSL certificates and web security products, 
to introduce a Premium DNS service that will be the perfect complement to our current, free of charge, standard DNS offering. 
While our standard DNS service is sufficient for users who don’t have any special needs when it comes to DNS resolution, 
we recognize the increasing demand of our customers in this area, and we are launching this new product in order to address their needs.
